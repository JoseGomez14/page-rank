# PageRank Implementation

This project is an implementation of the PageRank algorithm. 

The algorithm is implemented in two ways:
 - The simple implementation is a single-threaded implementation of the algorithm.

 - The improved implementation includes any optimizations:
    - The algorithm is Topic Sensitive.
    - The algorithm compute the PageRank avoiding the Dead Ends.
    - The algorithm compute the PageRank avoiding the Spider Traps.
    - The algorithm compute the TrustRank.
    - The algorithm compute the SpamMass.
